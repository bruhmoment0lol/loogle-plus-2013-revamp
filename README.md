Loogle+ Setup Guide

Info: I use localhost port 8090 for testing (localhost:8090).

Note: PHP 7 and 8 should run it, idk about other stuff.

https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/databases-mysql (I tested it on Ubuntu 23.10 and Fedora 39, php-mysql must be installed for myphpadmin)

1. Download myphpadmin and put it in the myphpadmin folder, https://www.phpmyadmin.net/

2. Create a database and input the SQL file.

3. Fill in the info in db.php.

4. Make sure you properly update all the URLs for the url, for the index.php and others. It will be added to a config file soon.
